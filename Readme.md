# Infinite Runner Game (Prototype)

This is a prototype for an endless runner game. This is a category of infinitely running games which require the player to dodge obstacles while continuously moving forwards. This genre of games include titles such as Kiloo's Subway Surfers, Halfbrick's Jetpack Joyride, Imagngi's Temple Run, and boatloads more.

This prototype mimics an endless runner having 3 lanes, each having randomly generated obstacles at regular intervals. The player must dodge the obstacles endlessly. This prototype cretes an illusion of "running" by doing the opposite - the floor underneath the player, including the obstacles, is the moving part, while the plauer remains stationary. Ultimately, thismeans that instead of the player moving towards the obstacles, we have the obstacles moving towards the player.
